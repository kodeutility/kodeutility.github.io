<ul>
  <li>Python 3 was released in 2008. </li>
  <li>Python is an interpreted language (in contrast to compiled languages like C,C++,Java)
    which means the interpreter will check the code line by line.
    No need of separate compilation and execution steps.</li>
  <li>Python uses indentation to identify the blocks of code .
    Indentation in python is a Tab space/4 spaces
    (in contrast to other languages like C,C++,Java which uses { } to specify blocks of code ).</li>
  <li>Python statements will not use any character to specify end of statement
    (in contrast to other languages like C,C++,Java which uses ; ).
    Statement in single line is considered as single line of code.</li>
  <li>In python we need not declare type of variable.
    Python automatically identifies the type of variable based on the value assigned to it. </li>
  <li>Python has 4 builtin data structures . List, Tuple, Set, Dictionary.</li>
  <li>Python language is case sensitive i.e python , Python, PYTHON are considered as different words.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Python Architecture</h3>

<p>Python architecture and its usual flow.</p>
<p>There are four steps that Python takes when we run python code.
  <ol>
    <li>Lexing</li>
    <li>Parsing</li>
    <li>Compiling</li>
    <li>Interpreting</li>
  </ol>
</p>
<p><strong>Lexing:</strong> Lexing is breaking the line of code we typed into tokens.</p>

<p><strong>Parsing:</strong> The parser takes those tokens and generates a structure that shows their relationship to each other.
For Python and many other langauges, this is the Abstract Syntax Tree (or AST).Think of your code as a tree.
 The top level is the root, a function might be a branch, a class is a branch and the class methods branch off that.
The statements are leaves within a branch.</p>

<p><strong>Compiling:</strong> The compiler takes the AST and turns it into one (or more) code objects(ByteCode).
Bytecode is the result of compiling source code written in a language.
Bytecode is the intermediary language between machine code (01010101) and the syntax tree.
The Byte-code sequence is the thing cached in .pyc files. </p>

<p><strong>Interpreting:</strong>  It takes the byte-code sequence and converts it into machine-specific operations.
  This is why Python.exe and Python for mac and Linux are all seperate binaries.
  Some byte codes need OS specific handling and checks. </p>
