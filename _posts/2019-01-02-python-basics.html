<ul>
  <li>Python 3 was released in 2008. </li>
  <li>Python is an interpreted language (in contrast to compiled languages like C,C++,Java)
    which means the interpreter will check the code line by line.
    No need of separate compilation and execution steps.</li>
  <li>Python uses indentation to identify the blocks of code .
    Indentation in python is a Tab space/4 spaces
    (in contrast to other languages like C,C++,Java which uses { } to specify blocks of code ).</li>
  <li>Python statements will not use any character to specify end of statement
    (in contrast to other languages like C,C++,Java which uses ; ).
    Statement in single line is considered as single line of code.</li>
  <li>In python we need not declare type of variable.
    Python automatically identifies the type of variable based on the value assigned to it. </li>
  <li>Python has 4 builtin data structures . List, Tuple, Set, Dictionary.</li>
  <li>Python language is case sensitive i.e python , Python, PYTHON are considered as different words.</li>
</ul>
