<ul>
  <li>Python 3 was released in 2008. </li>
  <li>Python is an interpreted language (in contrast to compiled languages like C,C++,Java)
    which means the interpreter will check the code line by line.
    No need of separate compilation and execution steps.</li>
  <li>Python uses indentation to identify the blocks of code .
    Indentation in python is a Tab space/4 spaces
    (in contrast to other languages like C,C++,Java which uses { } to specify blocks of code ).</li>
  <li>Python statements will not use any character to specify end of statement
    (in contrast to other languages like C,C++,Java which uses ; ).
    Statement in single line is considered as single line of code.</li>
  <li>In python we need not declare type of variable.
    Python automatically identifies the type of variable based on the value assigned to it. </li>
  <li>Python has 4 builtin data structures . List, Tuple, Set, Dictionary.</li>
  <li>Python language is case sensitive i.e python , Python, PYTHON are considered as different words.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Python Architecture</h3>

<p>Python architecture and its usual flow.
<br>There are four steps that Python takes when we run python code.
  <ol>
    <li>Lexing</li>
    <li>Parsing</li>
    <li>Compiling</li>
    <li>Interpreting</li>
  </ol>
</p>
<p><strong>Lexing:</strong> Lexing is breaking the line of code we typed into tokens.Tokens are constants which represent the numeric values <br>
E.g: PLUS, MINUS,NAME, NUMBER, EQUAL, LESS, DOT, GREATER, PERCENT</p>

<p><strong>Parsing:</strong> The parser takes those tokens and generates a structure that shows their relationship to each other.
For Python and many other langauges, this is the Abstract Syntax Tree (or AST).Think of your code as a tree.
 The top level is the root, a function might be a branch, a class is a branch and the class methods branch off that.
The statements are leaves within a branch.</p>

<p><strong>Compiling:</strong> The compiler takes the AST and turns it into one (or more) code objects(ByteCode).
Bytecode is the result of compiling source code written in a language.
Bytecode is the intermediary language between machine code (01010101) and the syntax tree.
The Byte-code sequence is the thing cached in .pyc files. </p>

<p><strong>Interpreting:</strong>  It takes the byte-code sequence and converts it into machine-specific operations.
  This is why Python.exe and Python for mac and Linux are all seperate binaries.
  Some byte codes need OS specific handling and checks.
  Interpreter executes the code line by line in a REPL (Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop) fashion.</p>

<h3>Python Flavours</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>CPython: </strong>Python implementation written in C, and is an interpreter.</li>
  <li><strong>Jython: </strong>Python implementation written in Java. A Jython program can import any Java class. It compiles to Java bytecode.</li>
  <li><strong>IronPython: </strong>Python implementation written in C#. It can function as an extensibility layer to application frameworks written in a .NET language.</li>
  <li><strong>Brython: </strong>Brython stands for Browser Python. It is an implementation of Python that runs in the browser.</li>
  <li><strong>RubyPython: </strong>Acts as a bridge between the Python and Ruby interpreters.</li>
  <li><strong>PyPy: </strong>Python implemented in Python.</li>
  <li><strong>MicroPython: </strong>Implementation of Python meant to run on a microcontroller. It uses a MicroPython board.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Various Python File Extensions</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>.py: </strong>Usual extension of python file.</li>
  <li><strong>.pyc: </strong>Compiled bytecode. This code is then executed by Python's virtual machine.</li>
  <li><strong>.pyd: </strong>Windows DLL(dynamic link library) file</li>
  <li><strong>.pyo: </strong>File created with optimizations</li>
  <li><strong>.pyw: </strong>Python script for Windows</li>
  <li><strong>.pyz: </strong>Python script archive.Packages all source code and dependencies into a single Python zip application.</li>
</ul>
