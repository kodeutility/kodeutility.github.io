<h3>Statement</h3>
<p>Since python is interpreted language the interpreter reads and executes the statements line by line from top to bottom.</p>
<p>Python Statement : Instructions that a Python interpreter can execute are called statements.<br>
For example, x = 1 is an assignment statement.</p>

<p>Mostly, python statements are written in such a format that one statement is only written in a single line.
  The interpreter considers the ‘new line character’ as the terminator of one instruction.
  But, writing multiple statements per line is also possible.
  We can use this when we want to continue a long python statement in a new line using ' \ ' for line continuation.</p>

  <pre class="language-python line-numbers">
  <code>sum = 1+2+ \
              3+4+ \
              5+6
  #which translates into
  sum = 1+2+3+4+5+6
  </code></pre>

<p>For writing multiple statements in one line we can use ; to separate each statements</p>

<pre class="language-python line-numbers">
<code>x=10; y=20; z=30
</code></pre>

<p>In python line continuation is implicitly for code inside parentheses ( ), brackets [ ], braces { }.</p>

<pre class="language-python line-numbers">
<code>
  sum = ( 1+2+
          3+4+
          5+6 )

  programming_languages = [ 'python',
                          'java',
                          'c++',
                          'kotlin' ]

  car_details =	{
                 "brand": "Ford",
                 "model": "Mustang",
                 "year": 1964
                }
</code></pre>

<h3>Indentation</h3>

<p>Python uses indentation to identify the blocks of code .
  Indentation in python is generally a Tab space/4 white spaces (in contrast to other languages like C, C++, Java
  which uses braces { } to specify blocks of code ). A code block (body of a function, loop etc.)
  starts with indentation and ends with the first unindented line. The amount of indentation is up to you,
  but it must be consistent throughout that block. Using indentation as a rule makes the code look clean and increase readability.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Indentation can be ignored in line continuation. But it's a good idea to always indent.
  It makes the code more readable. If we have not provided proper indentation python tells us by throwing <strong>IndentationError</strong>.
</p>

<h3>Comment</h3>

<p>Comments in Python start with the hash character, #, and extend to the end of the physical line.
  A comment may appear at the start of a line or following whitespace or code, but not within a string literal.
  A hash character within a string literal is just a hash character.
  Since comments are to clarify code and are not interpreted by Python, they may be omitted when typing inside quotes.</p>

<h6>test.py</h6>
<pre class="language-python line-numbers">
<code>#This is a comment
#print out Hello to console
print('Hello')
</code></pre>
<h6>Output</h6>
<pre class="language-none">
<code>Hello
</code></pre>

<p>If we have comments that extend multiple lines, one way of doing it is to use hash (#) in the beginning of each line.
  Another way of doing this is to use triple quotes, either ''' or """.
</p>

<pre class="language-python line-numbers">
<code>#This is a long comment
#and it extends
#to multiple lines

""" This is also a
perfect example of
multi-line comments """

''' This is also a
perfect example of
multi-line comments '''
</code></pre>

<p>''' or """ ( Triple quotes )are also called as <strong>Documentation String</strong>.
  String which occurs as the first statement in a module, function, class, or method definition.
  We must write what a function/class does in the docstring.
</p>

<p>Docstring is available to us as the attribute <em>__doc__</em> of the function.</p>

<h6>test.py</h6>
<pre class="language-python line-numbers">
<code>from math import ceil
print(ceil.__doc__)
</code></pre>

<h6>Output</h6>
<pre class="language-none">
<code>ceil(x)

Return the ceiling of x as an Integral.
This is the smallest integer >= x.
</code></pre>
