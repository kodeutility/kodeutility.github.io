<p>Most of the time in programming we need to make decisions based on some logic. 
  If-elif-else are used to make decisions in python.</p>

<h3>Python if Syntax</h3>
<p><em>if test expression:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;statement(s) </em></p>

<p>The program evaluates the test expression and will execute statement(s) only if the text expression is True.
If the text expression is False, the statement(s) is not executed.
<br>
The body of the if statement is indicated by the indentation. Body starts with an indentation and the first unindented line marks the end.</p>
