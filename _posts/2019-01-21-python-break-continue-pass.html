<p>break and continue statements are used to alter the flow of a normal loop.
Loops iterate over a block of code until test expression is false, but sometimes we wish to terminate the current iteration or even the whole loop without checking test expression.
<br>
The break and continue statements are used in these cases.</p>
<br>
<h3break</h3>
<p>The break statement terminates the loop containing it. Control of the program flows to the statement immediately after the body of the loop.
If break statement is inside a nested loop (loop inside another loop), break will terminate the innermost loop.</p>

<h6>test.py</h6>
<pre class="language-python line-numbers">
<code># Use of break statement inside loop

for val in &quot;string&quot;:
    if val == &quot;i&quot;:
        break
    print(val)

print(&quot;The end&quot;)
</code></pre>

<h6>Output</h6>
<pre class="language-none">
<code>s
t
r
The end
</code></pre>

<br>
<h3>continue </h3>
<p>The continue statement is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. 
Loop does not terminate but continues on with the next iteration.
</p>

<h6>test.py</h6>
<pre class="language-python line-numbers">
<code>for val in &quot;string&quot;:
    if val == &quot;i&quot;:
        continue
    print(val)

print(&quot;The end&quot;)
</code></pre>

<h6>Output</h6>
<pre class="language-none">
<code>s
t
r
n
g
The end
</code></pre>

<br>
<h3>pass</h3>
<p>pass is a null statement. 
The difference between a comment and pass statement in Python is that, while the interpreter ignores a comment entirely, pass is not ignored.
However, nothing happens when pass is executed. It results into no operation (NOP).
We generally use it as a placeholder.<br>
Suppose we have a loop or a function that is not implemented yet, but we want to implement it in the future. 
They cannot have an empty body. The interpreter would complain. So, we use the pass statement to construct a body that does nothing.
We can do the same thing in an empty function or class as well.</p>

<h6>test.py</h6>
<pre class="language-python line-numbers">
<code>sequence = {'p', 'a', 's', 's'}
for val in sequence:
    pass
</code></pre>

<h6>Output</h6>
<pre class="language-none">
<code>
</code></pre>
<p>No output as we id nothing for each iteration in for loop</p>
