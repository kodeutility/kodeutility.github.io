<p>Loops are used when we have to repeatedly execute certain piece of code.
The for loop in Python is used to iterate over a sequence (list, tuple, string) or other iterable objects.
Iterating over a sequence is called traversal.
<br><em>
for val in sequence:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Body of for
	</em><br>
val is the variable that takes the value of the item inside the sequence on each iteration.
Loop continues until we reach the last item in the sequence.
The body of for loop is separated from the rest of the code using indentation.

<h6>test.py</h6>
<pre class="language-python line-numbers">
<code># Program to find the sum of all numbers stored in a list

# List of numbers
numbers = [6, 5, 3, 8, 4, 2, 5, 4, 11]

# variable to store the sum
sum = 0

# iterate over the list
for val in numbers:
	sum = sum+val

# Output: The sum is 48
print(&quot;The sum is&quot;, sum)
</code></pre>

<h6>Output</h6>
<pre class="language-none">
<code>The sum is 48
</code></pre>

<h3>range()</h3>
<p>A sequence of numbers can be generated using range() function.<br>
	Syntax : <em>range(start, stop, step size)</em> <br>
	step size is <strong>1</strong> if not provided.
This function does not store all the values in memory, it would be inefficient. 
So it remembers the start, stop, step size and generates the next number on the go.<br>
To actually see the numbers generated by range() we can put it in a list.
We can use the range() function in for loops to iterate through a sequence of numbers.
</p>

<h6>test.py</h6>
<pre class="language-python line-numbers">
<code>print(range(10))
print(20*'-')

print(list(range(10)))
print(20*'-')

print(list(range(2, 8)))
print(20*'-')

print(list(range(2, 20, 3)))
</code></pre>

<h6>Output</h6>
<pre class="language-none">
<code>range(0, 10)
--------------------
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
--------------------
[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
--------------------
[2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17]
</code></pre>

<br>
<h3>for loop with else</h3>
<p>A for loop can have an optional else block as well. 
The else part is executed if the items in the sequence used in for loop exhausts.
break statement can be used to stop a for loop. In such case, the else part is ignored.
Hence, a for loop's else part runs if no break occurs.</p>

<h6>test.py</h6>
<pre class="language-python line-numbers">
<code>digits = [0, 1, 5]

for i in digits:
    print(i)
else:
    print(&quot;No items left.&quot;)
</code></pre>

<h6>Output</h6>
<pre class="language-none">
<code>0
1
5
No items left.
</code></pre>
