<p>Python offers a range of compound datatypes often referred to as sequences. 
List is one of the most frequently used and very versatile datatype used in Python.
Unlike other languages, Python Programming Language don't have arrays. 
To hold a sequence of values, it provides the ‘list’ class.
A Python list can be seen as a collection of values.</p>

<h3>Creating a list</h3>
<p>a list is created by placing all the items (elements) inside a square bracket [ ], separated by commas.
It can have any number of items and they may be of different types (integer, float, string etc.)
Also, a list can even have another list as an item. This is called nested list.</p>
