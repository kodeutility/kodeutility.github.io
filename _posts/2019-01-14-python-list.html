<p>Python offers a range of compound datatypes often referred to as sequences. 
List is one of the most frequently used and very versatile datatype used in Python.
Unlike other languages, Python Programming Language don't have arrays. 
To hold a sequence of values, it provides the ‘list’ class.
A Python list can be seen as a collection of values.</p>

<h3>Creating a list</h3>
<p>a list is created by placing all the items (elements) inside a square bracket [ ], separated by commas.
It can have any number of items and they may be of different types (integer, float, string etc.)
Also, a list can even have another list as an item. This is called nested list.</p>

<h6>test.py</h6>
<pre class="language-python line-numbers">
<code># empty list
my_list = []

# list of integers
number_list = [1, 2, 3]

# list of strings
colors=['red','green','blue']

# list with mixed datatypes
mixed_list = [1, &quot;Hello&quot;, 3.4]

# nested list
nested_list = [&quot;mouse&quot;, [8, 4, 6], ['a']]
languages=[['English'],['Gujarati'],['Hindi'],'Romanian','Spanish']

print(colors)
print(type(colors))
</code></pre>

<h6>Output</h6>
<pre class="language-none">
<code>['red', 'green', 'blue']
&lt;class 'list'&gt;
</code></pre>

<h3>Accessing python list</h3>
<p>There are various ways in which we can access the elements of a list.</p>

<h4>List Index</h4>
<p>We can use the index operator [] to access an item in a list. Index starts from 0. 
So, a list having 5 elements will have index from 0 to 4.
<br>
Trying to access an element other that this will raise an <strong>IndexError</strong>. 
The index must be an integer. We can't use float or other types, this will result into <strong>TypeError</strong>.
Nested list are accessed using nested indexing.</p>
