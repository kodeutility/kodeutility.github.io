<p>Variables are used to store information to be referenced and manipulated in a computer program.
  They also provide a way of labeling data with a descriptive name,
  so our programs can be understood more clearly by the reader and ourselves.
  It is helpful to think of variables as containers that hold information.
  Their sole purpose is to label and store data in memory. This data can then be used throughout your program.
  Each variable must have a unique name called identifier.<br>In Python, we don’t define the type of the variable.
  It is assumed on the basis of the value it holds.</p>

<p>In Python we don't assign values to the variables, whereas Python gives the reference of the object (value) to the variable.
  Anything that could be named ( list, string, integer, or function ) in the language is an object that belongs to the corresponding class.</p>

  <h3>Declaring Variables in Python</h3>
  <p>In Python, variables do not need declaration to reserve memory space.
    The "variable declaration" or "variable initialization" happens automatically when we assign a value to a variable.
    <br>We can use the assignment operator = to assign the value to a variable.
</p>

<h6>test.py</h6>
<pre class="language-python line-numbers">
<code>var=10
print(var)
var='Hello'
print(var)
</code></pre>

<h6>Output</h6>
<pre class="language-none">
<code>10
Hello
</code></pre>

<p>Here, we declared a variable 'var', and assigned it a value of 10. Then we printed its value.
  Next, we assigned it the value ‘Hello’, and printed it out.
  So, we see, a variable can hold any type of value at a later instant.
  Hence, Python is a dynamically-typed language. It can automatically infer (know) the type of the variable.</p>

<h3>Assigning multiple values to multiple variables</h3>

<h6>test.py</h6>
<pre class="language-python line-numbers">
<code>num_1, num_2, num_3 = 5, 3.2, "Hello"

print (num_1)
print (num_2)
print (num_3)
</code></pre>

<h6>Output</h6>
<pre class="language-none">
<code>5
3.2
Hello
</code></pre>

<p>If we want to assign the same value to multiple variables at once, we can do this as</p>
<h6>test.py</h6>
<pre class="language-python line-numbers">
<code>num_1 = num_2 = num_3 = 10

print (num_1)
print (num_2)
print (num_3)
</code></pre>

<h6>Output</h6>
<pre class="language-none">
<code>10
10
10
</code></pre>

<h3>Constants</h3>
<p>A constant is a type of variable whose value cannot be changed.
  It is helpful to think of constants as containers that hold information which cannot be changed later.</p>

<p>In Python, constants are usually declared and assigned on a module.
  Here, the module means a new file containing variables, functions etc which is imported to main file.
  Inside the module, constants are written in all capital letters and underscores separating the words.</p>

<h6>constant.py</h6>
<pre class="language-python line-numbers">
<code>PI = 3.14
GRAVITY = 9.8
</code></pre>

<h6>main.py</h6>
<pre class="language-python line-numbers">
<code>import constant

print(constant.PI)
print(constant.GRAVITY)
</code></pre>

<h6>Output</h6>
<pre class="language-none">
<code>3.14
9.8
</code></pre>
