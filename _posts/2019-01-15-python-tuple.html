A tuple is similar to a list. 
The difference between the two is that we cannot change the elements of a 
tuple once it is assigned whereas in a list, elements can be changed.

<h3>Advantages of Tuple over List</h3>
<p>Since, tuples are quite similiar to lists, both of them are used in similar situations as well.<br>
There are certain advantages of implementing a tuple over a list. </p>
<ul>
  <li>We generally use tuple for heterogeneous (different) datatypes and list for homogeneous (similar) datatypes.</li>
  <li>Since tuple are immutable, iterating through tuple is faster than with list. So there is a slight performance boost.</li>
  <li>Tuples that contain immutable elements can be used as key for a dictionary. With list, this is not possible.</li>
  <li>If you have data that doesn't change, implementing it as tuple will guarantee that it remains write-protected.
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Creating a Tuple</h3>
<p>A tuple is created by placing all the items (elements) inside a parentheses (), separated by comma. 
  The parentheses are optional but is a good practice to write it.
   A tuple can have any number of items and they may be of different types (integer, float, list, string etc.).</p>

<pre class="language-python line-numbers">
<code># empty tuple
# Output: ()
my_tuple = ()
print(my_tuple)

# tuple having integers
# Output: (1, 2, 3)
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
print(my_tuple)

# tuple with mixed datatypes
# Output: (1, &quot;Hello&quot;, 3.4)
my_tuple = (1, &quot;Hello&quot;, 3.4)
print(my_tuple)

# nested tuple
# Output: (&quot;mouse&quot;, [8, 4, 6], (1, 2, 3))
my_tuple = (&quot;mouse&quot;, [8, 4, 6], (1, 2, 3))
print(my_tuple)

# tuple can be created without parentheses
# also called tuple packing
# Output: 3, 4.6, &quot;dog&quot;

my_tuple = 3, 4.6, &quot;dog&quot;
print(my_tuple)

# tuple unpacking is also possible
# Output:
# 3
# 4.6
# dog
a, b, c = my_tuple
print(a)
print(b)
print(c)

#We can use tuple unpacking to assign values to multiple
#variables at once. But the number of values should be equal to variables
str_1, str_2, str_3 = &quot;one&quot;,&quot;two&quot;,&quot;three&quot;
print(&quot;Tuple unpacking:&quot;)
print(str_1)
print(str_2)
print(str_3)

<h6>Output</h6>

<code>()
(1, 2, 3)
(1, 'Hello', 3.4)
('mouse', [8, 4, 6], (1, 2, 3))

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong>For creating a tuple with one element, just having one element within parentheses is not enough. 
  We will need a trailing comma to indicate that it is in fact a tuple.</p>

<h6>test.py</h6>
<pre class="language-python line-numbers">
<code># only parentheses is not enough
# Output: &lt;class 'str'&gt;
my_tuple = (&quot;hello&quot;)
print(type(my_tuple))

# need a comma at the end
# Output: &lt;class 'tuple'&gt;
my_tuple = (&quot;hello&quot;,)  
print(type(my_tuple))

# parentheses is optional
# Output: &lt;class 'tuple'&gt;
my_tuple = &quot;hello&quot;,
print(type(my_tuple))
</code></pre>

<pre class="language-none">

&lt;class 'tuple'&gt;
&lt;class 'tuple'&gt;

<h3>Accessing Elements in a Tuple</h3>
<p>There are various ways in which we can access the elements of a tuple.</p>
<h4>Indexing<h4>
<p>We can use the index operator [] to access an item in a tuple where the index starts from 0. 
So, a tuple having 6 elements will have index from 0 to 5. 
  Trying to access an element other that (6, 7,...) will raise an <strong>IndexError</strong>. 
The index must be an integer, so we cannot use float or other types. This will result into <strong>TypeError</strong>.</p>

<h6>test.py</h6>
<pre class="language-python line-numbers">
<code>my_tuple = ('p','e','r','m','i','t')

# Output: 'p'
print(my_tuple[0])

# Output: 't'
print(my_tuple[5])

# index must be in range
# If you uncomment line 14,
# you will get an error.
# IndexError: list index out of range

#print(my_tuple[6])

# index must be an integer
# If you uncomment line 21,
# you will get an error.
# TypeError: list indices must be integers, not float

#my_tuple[2.0]

# nested tuple
n_tuple = (&quot;mouse&quot;, [8, 4, 6], (1, 2, 3))

# nested index
# Output: 's'
print(n_tuple[0][3])

# nested index
# Output: 4
print(n_tuple[1][1])
