<p>The while loop in Python is used to iterate over a block of code as long as the test expression (condition) is true.
We generally use this loop when we don't know beforehand, the number of times to iterate.
We need to increase the value of counter variable in the body of the loop. 
This is very important (and mostly forgotten). Failing to do so will result in an infinite loop (never ending loop).</p>
<p>Syntax<br>
  <em>while test_expression:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Body of while</em></p>
<p>In while loop, test expression is checked first. The body of the loop is entered only if the test_expression evaluates to True. 
After one iteration, the test expression is checked again. This process continues until the test_expression evaluates to False.
<br>In Python, the body of the while loop is determined through indentation.
Body starts with indentation and the first unindented line marks the end.
All non-zero value are considered as True. None and 0 are interpreted as False.</p>

<h6>test.py</h6>
<pre class="language-python line-numbers">
<code># Program to add natural
# numbers upto 
# sum = 1+2+3+...+n

# To take input from the user,
# n = int(input(&quot;Enter n: &quot;))

n = 10

# initialize sum and counter
sum = 0
i = 1

while i &lt;= n:
    sum = sum + i
    i = i+1    # update counter

# print the sum
print(&quot;The sum is&quot;, sum)
</code></pre>

<h6>Output</h6>
<pre class="language-none">
<code>The sum is 55
</code></pre>

<h3>while loop with else</h3>
<p>Same as that of for loop, we can have an optional else block with while loop as well.

The else part is executed if the condition in the while loop evaluates to False.
<br>
The while loop can be terminated with a break statement. In such case, the else part is ignored. 
  Hence, a while loop's else part runs if no break occurs and the condition is false.</p>

<h6>test.py</h6>
<pre class="language-python line-numbers">
<code># Example to illustrate
# the use of else statement
# with the while loop

counter = 0

while counter &lt; 3:
    print(&quot;Inside loop&quot;)
    counter = counter + 1
else:
    print(&quot;Inside else&quot;)
</code></pre>

<h6>Output</h6>
<pre class="language-none">
<code>Inside loop
Inside loop
Inside loop
Inside else
</code></pre>
