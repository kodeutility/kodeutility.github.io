<code>The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

<br><h3>Python Name</h3>
<p>Python name is an identifier which we use to access a python object. In python everthing is an object.
  <br>We use <strong>id()</strong> function to get object's address in RAM.</p>

<h6>test.py</h6>
<pre class="language-python line-numbers">
<code>num_1 = 10

print(&quot;Value of num_1:&quot;,num_1)

#Let's print address of variable 'num'
print(&quot;address/id of num_1 object:&quot;,id(num_1))
#Let's print address of value 10
print(&quot;address of Number object 10:&quot;,id(10))
#Both have same value since num_1 is pointing to Number object 10

print(30*'-')

num_1 += 5
print(&quot;New value of num_1:&quot;,num_1)
print(&quot;address/id of new num_1 object:&quot;,id(num_1))
print(&quot;address of Number object 15:&quot;,id(15))
#Both have same value since num_1 is now pointing to Number object 15

print(30*'-')

num_2 = 10
print(&quot;address/id of num_2 object:&quot;,id(num_2))
print(&quot;address of Number object 10:&quot;,id(10))
#Notice when num_2 is created with value 10
#It points to old address of num_1 where Number object 10 is stored
#It does not create a new value in memory 
</code></pre>

<h6>Output</h6>
<pre class="language-none">
<code>Value of num_1: 10
